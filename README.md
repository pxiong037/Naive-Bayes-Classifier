# Naive-Bayes-Classifier
First Machine Learning Program

Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm is based on Bayes Theorem. This program implements a Naive Bayes Algorithm using numpy arrays to predict the classes of each sample in a dataset. The dataset is written within the program itself.

Bayes Theorem:
P(c|x) = (P(x|c) * P(c)) / P(x)

Where:

P(c|x) is the posterior probability of class (c, target) given predictor (x, attributes).
P(c) is the prior probability of class.
P(x|c) is the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given class.
P(x) is the prior probability of predictor.
